# ðŸŒž Streamlit App Module â€” Solar Potential Dashboard

This directory contains the core Streamlit application for visualizing and analyzing solar potential data from **Benin**, **Sierra Leone**, and **Togo**. The app provides interactive visualizations, key performance indicators (KPIs), and summary statistics to aid in identifying regions with high solar energy potential.

**Key Features:**
- Sidebar for country and metric selection (`GHI`, `DNI`, `DHI`)
- Slider for filtering values within a desired solar metric range
- Boxplots of metric distributions by country
- KPI cards showing average metric values per country
- Annotated bar chart of average metric values
